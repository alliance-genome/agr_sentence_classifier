Professional curators identify relevant textual evidence\u2014often at the sentence level\u2014from primary literature to ensure that key experimental findings are captured in standardized ontologies and associated with original sources.\n\n    This classification aids in guiding curators and authors to statements that can be used directly or indirectly to create annotations.

Professional curators identify relevant textual evidence\u2014often at the sentence level\u2014from primary literature to ensure that key experimental findings are captured in standardized ontologies and associated with original sources.\n\n    This classification aids in guiding curators and authors to statements that can be used directly or indirectly to create annotations.
