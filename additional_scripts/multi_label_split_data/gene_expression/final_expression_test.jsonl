Professional curators identify relevant textual evidence\u2014often at the sentence level\u2014from primary literature to ensure that key experimental findings are captured in standardized ontologies and associated with original sources.\n\n    This classification aids in guiding curators and authors to statements that can be used directly or indirectly to create annotations.

Your goal is to classify a given sentence according to whether it contains information suitable for biocuration tasks focused on gene expression. Consider that the sentences come from full-text scientific articles and may reflect various experimental contexts, including direct experimental results, summarized findings, previously published information, and related methodological details.\n\n    Background\n    Biocuration involves extracting high-quality, trustworthy information about gene function and expression patterns from published references and integrating these data into knowledgebases. Professional curators identify relevant textual evidence\u2014often at the sentence level\u2014from primary literature to ensure that key experimental findings are captured in standardized ontologies and associated with original sources.\n\n    This classification aids in guiding curators and authors to statements that can be used directly or indirectly to create annotations. With the large volume of literature and the complexity of biomedical data, semi-automated tools help make curation more efficient while maintaining quality.\n\n    Data Type of Interest: Gene Expression\n    Relevant sentences may include:\n    - Mention of a specific gene or gene product by name.\n    - Terms or phrases indicating gene expression (e.g., \u201cexpressed,\u201d \u201clocalized,\u201d \u201cdetected in,\u201d \u201cpresent in\u201d).\n    - Spatial or temporal context for the expression (e.g., a particular tissue, cell type, developmental stage).\n\n    Fully Curatable Gene Expression Data:\n    A fully curatable sentence typically includes all elements needed for a direct annotation: the gene, evidence of its expression, and the anatomical/cellular location and/or the developmental stage.\n\n    Partially Curatable Gene Expression Data:\n    A partially curatable sentence may mention some relevant information but not all. Additional sentences would be needed to complete the annotation.\n\n    Curation-Related Terms (Related Language):\n    Some sentences might not provide direct or partial annotation details but still contain terms associated with gene expression experiments (e.g., reporter constructs, in situ hybridization, qPCR methods, antibodies for detection). These sentences signal relevance but are not directly curatable.\n\n    Non-Curation-Related Content:\n    If a sentence contains no gene expression-relevant information, does not name genes or mention expression, and does not include methodological details relevant to gene expression, it falls into this category.\n\n    Additional Notes:\n    - Some sentences summarize previously published results or mention mutant backgrounds. If they contain expression-related terms but are not suitable for direct annotation, classify them as related language.\n    - If a single sentence lacks all critical pieces but is on-topic, it is partially curatable or related language depending on the details.\n    - Consider if the sentence reports actual experimental findings or only provides background/methodological context.\n\n    Classify the sentence into one of four categories. Please return EXACTLY one of the four following sentences as your classification with no extra text:\n    This sentence only contains fully curatable data.\n    This sentence only contains partially curatable data.\n    This sentence is not fully or partially curatable, but it contains terms related to the datatype.\n    This sentence does not contain fully or partially curatable data, or terms related to the datatype."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Then the Type I receptor phosphorylates a receptor-associated Smad protein (R-Smad), causing the R-Smad to form a complex with a Co-Smad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This sentence does not contain fully or partially curatable data, or terms related to the datatype."}]}
