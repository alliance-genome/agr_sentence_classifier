However, based on the model of the smooth 2-nonanone gradient, C. elegans are estimated to respond to a concentration change of about 0.01 μM/sec, which is consistent with behavioral response in a constant odor concentration change in artificial flow (Tanimoto et al., 2017).	0	0	0	NEGATIVE	TESTING

Interestingly, PQ401 rescued 100% of C. elegans worms from MRSA infections at one-half the MIC, whereas vancomycin rescued 100% only at 1ϫ MIC (Fig. 6A), indicating that PQ401 may provide additional beneficial bioactivity to combat MRSA infections.	0	0	0	NEGATIVE	TESTING
